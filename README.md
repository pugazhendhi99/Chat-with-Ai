## ‚ö° How It Works

1. **User pastes code, uploads a file, or asks a question**
2. **App sends the input to the backend API**

4. **AI responds with explanations, fixes, or suggestions**
5. **Frontend displays the response with syntax highlighting and chat UI**

## üõ°Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "No response from AI" or "Failed to process your request"

- **Check your OpenAI API key** in `.env.local` (no quotes, correct key)
- **Restart your dev server** after any change to `.env.local`
- **Check your OpenAI account billing:** You must have an active payment method or credits for API access (https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview)
- **Check your terminal for errors** (401 = invalid key or no payment)

### Styles not applied / UI looks broken

- Make sure `app/layout.tsx` imports `../styles/globals.css`
- Restart your dev server
